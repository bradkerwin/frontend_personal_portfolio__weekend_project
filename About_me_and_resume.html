            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
            I attended Salem State University where I graduated with <br>
            a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice and a minor in <br>
            Sociology. While I did enjoy studying these fields, I was <br>
            looking for a different career path. I enrolled in Coding <br>
            Temple and I plan to become a software engineer upon <br>
            graduating.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of school, I like running, playing basketball, <br>
                watching sports, and playing video games. I currently <br>
                work part time while I am enrolled in Coding Temple. <br>
            </p>
