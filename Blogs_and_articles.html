            <h3>Blog About Creating Your Own Workout Plans</h3>
            <p>
                I get multiple emails and messages per day asking:

“Steve, what should I do for a workout?”

Well, partner, today is your lucky day.

I’m gonna help build you a custom workout program, step-by-step! 
After all, a workout should be developed around a person’s training age, goals, 
injury history, free time, and available equipment, not to mention things you 
ENJOY doing!
Considering all those factors, it’s easy to overcomplicate this process. 
There are a seemingly infinite number of exercises, sets, reps, and programs 
to choose from. Don’t worry – together, we’ll cut through the noise and get to 
the good stuff.Now, if you’re somebody that wants to skip all of that, and JUST 
be told what exactly to do: 
We build customized workouts for our Online Coaching Clients and would love to 
have you. We get to know your story: your goals, challenges, and lifestyle. 
Then we develop a workout plan specific to your schedule and needs.
